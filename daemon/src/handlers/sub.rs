//! `GET /sub/<token>` — opaque-token-keyed sing-box client config.
//!
//! Hiddify-style clients are pointed at this URL once and re-pull on
//! their own schedule. We resolve the token to a user, walk all servers
//! granted to that user, and emit a sing-box client JSON containing one
//! outbound per (server × protocol) plus a selector for switching.
//!
//! Phase Track-1 hook: every successful resolve (200) writes one row
//! into `sub_access_log` so the admin can see "how many distinct IPs
//! are pulling THIS user's URL". Failed resolves (404 unknown token)
//! are deliberately NOT logged — we don't want a probing attacker to
//! be able to fill the table by spamming garbage tokens.
